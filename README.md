# Project-Inherit
**Team iwanttocommit**

Project Inherit is a web application that will keep track of family artifacts to be passed down the generations. 
It works through the sharing of family groups where members can be added and contribute their own photos of artifacts.
It is easy to store the name, description and photo of artifacts, leave comments and assign them to groups.
In addition to this, users can update their family by creating posts!

## Features
### Core Functions

1. Sign Up/Login

    New users can create an account, whilst existing ones will be able to sign in with their credentials. If a family has not been created yet, users will be able to create a group for their family and add/invite members.

2. Creating a Family Group
    
    If a family group has not yet been created, users have the option to start a new one. Posts can be shared on the family group. 
    
3. Creating an Artifact
    
    Users can create artifacts for themselves to store, or assign them to a family group. Once assigned to a group, members can view that artifact and leave a comment. 
    
4. Adding Family Members

    Once a user has created a group, they can search for other members who have created an account and add them to the family group.
